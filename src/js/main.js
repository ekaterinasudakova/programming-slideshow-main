// new rule: no unintended consequences.
// don't fuck with anything else on the page.
// if we have more than one slideshow, they should run independently.
// that means SCOPE! both in variables and in finding elements
// for the variable scope we're actually going to learn a whole new technique, called Functional Prototypes
// this is where you write a function that builds a nice, self contained thing for you.
// everything it needs is inside the function, and nothing is left outside, lying around, for other devs to metaphorically step on
// if something is needed from outside, you can write your function to selectively expose certain things.
